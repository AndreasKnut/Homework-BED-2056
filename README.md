# Welcome to this homework for BED-2056
 
This is a mandatory homework assignment which will give you an introduction to git, RMarkdown, and projects in R.

The assignment must be done in two steps:

## Step 1

Create a [github account (www.github.com)](https://www.github.com) and send your account details to oerjan.myrland@gmail.com. It must include

```
name: your name
username: your username
email: your email
```

Copy/paste the above lines and change **your name**, **your username** and **your email**

**In the subject field (emnefelt), _only_ write**

```
github_account
```

Nothing else. Just copy/paste the above line to the subject field without changing it.

Do this as soon as possible. I have to grant you write permission to this repository.
